following modules must be made:

-make a modules and plugins architecture with well defined interfaces

all of the following as interfaces:
- decryptor
- bruteforce decryptor with password list
- output parser interface (e.g. for reading unrar output) 
- reporter (which will make objects out of the results)
- reportConvertor which will transform the output to db, json, flatfile etc.
- multiExtractor/Tester
- corruptionTester which will test multi archives for CRC
- parts missing, shows you exactly which parts are missing from which multi archive
- fileSystemSnooper which will search the whole filesystem or recurively any given path for archives and
  stores a lot of file and directory information e.g. total amount of data to be processed (e.g. for progressbar)
- progressor which will show progress while extracting/testing
